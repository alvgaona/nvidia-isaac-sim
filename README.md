# NVIDIA Isaac Sim

This repository contains different configurations of Isaac Sim that can run on both Linux, and Windows;
it is possible as Isaac Sim can be run on Docker containers pretty easily.
All of these setups contain a ROS2 distribution working out-of-the-box,

Installing ROS2 is sometimes a big lift but not anymore with the Pixi package manager
by [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev/), so I take advantage of that to setup ROS along
Isaac Sim with the lowest friction possible.
